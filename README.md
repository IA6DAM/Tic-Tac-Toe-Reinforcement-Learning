# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project explores reinforcement learning techniques, including dynamic programming and model-free methods, to teach an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Through both policy evaluation and Q-learning approaches, this project aims to enhance understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms and their application in classic games.

## Project Details
This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Dynamic programming techniques help the agent learn optimal strategies based on state evaluation, while model-free algorithms like Monte Carlo and Q-learning allow it to improve through experience.

### Algorithms Used
- **Dynamic Programming**: Classical approach with policy evaluation.
- **Model-Free Methods**: Includes Monte Carlo policy evaluation and Q-learning. 

## Project Structure

- **Dynamic_Programming/** - Contains code for implementing dynamic programming techniques.
- **MC_PolicyEvaluation.py** - Script for Monte Carlo policy evaluation.
- **Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation.txt** - Documentation on Monte Carlo policy evaluation process.
- **notes.txt** - Project notes and observations.
- **PE_MonteCarlo.py** - Script for policy evaluation using Monte Carlo methods.
- **Q_learning withinGym.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook demonstrating Q-learning implementation.
- **Q_Learning.py** - Script for implementing Q-learning.
- **TicTacToeAgent/** - Agent implementation for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Requirements
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` if provided or install the standard reinforcement learning libraries, e.g., `gym`.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IA6DAM/Tic-Tac-Toe-Reinforcement-Learning.git
   cd Tp_RL
   ```

2. **Run Algorithms**:
